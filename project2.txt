For example,
Input:
Enter any number: 12

Output: 
This number is Even.

ans: #include <stdio.h>
void main (){
    int number;
    printf("type number");
    scanf("%d",&number);
    (number%2==0)?printf("this number is even",number):printf("this number is odd",number);
}

Q.2 Write a Program to input electricity unit charges and calculate the total electricity bill according to the given condition:
For the first 50 units Rs. 0.50/unit
For the next 100 units Rs. 0.75/unit
For the next 100 units Rs. 1.20/unit
For units above 250 Rs. 1.50/unit
An additional surcharge of 20% is added to the bill.
For example,
Input:
Enter electricity units: 435

Output: 
Electricity Bill = Rs. 597.00

ans: 


#include <stdio.h>
void main() {
    float units, bill = 0;

    printf("Enter electricity units: ");
    scanf("%f", &units);

    if (units <= 50) {
        bill = units * 0.50;
    } else if (units <= 150) {
        bill = 50 * 0.50 + (units - 50) * 0.75;
    } else if (units <= 250) {
        bill = 50 * 0.50 + 100 * 0.75 + (units - 150) * 1.20;
    } else {
        bill = 50 * 0.50 + 100 * 0.75 + 100 * 1.20 + (units - 250) * 1.50;
    }

    bill*=1.20; 
    // add 20% surcharge

    printf("Electricity Bill = Rs. %.2f\n", bill);

    
}
